  # Send a message to Slack using the Web API.
  #
  # This method is usually called when a Hubot script is sending a message in response to an incoming message. The
  # response object has a `send()` method, which triggers execution of all response middleware, and ultimately calls
  # `send()` on the Adapter. SlackBot, the adapter in this case, delegates that call to this method; once for every item
  # (since its method signature is variadic). The `envelope` is created by the Hubot Response object.
  #
  # This method can also be called when a script directly calls `robot.send()` or `robot.adapter.send()`. That bypasses
  # the execution of the response middleware and directly calls into SlackBot#send(). In this case, the `envelope`
  # parameter is up to the script.
  #
  # The `envelope.room` property is intended to be a conversation ID. Even when that is not the case, this method will
  # makes a reasonable attempt at sending the message. If the property is set to a public or private channel name, it
  # will still work. When there's no `room` in the envelope, this method will fallback to the `id` property. That
  # affordance allows scripts to use Hubot User objects, Slack users (as obtained from the response to `users.info`),
  # and Slack conversations (as obtained from the response to `conversations.info`) as possible envelopes. In the first
  # two cases, envelope.id` will contain a user ID (`Uxxx` or `Wxxx`). Since Hubot runs using a bot token (`xoxb`),
  # passing a user ID as the `channel` argument to `chat.postMessage` (with `as_user=true`) results in a DM from the bot
  # user (if `as_user=false` it would instead result in a DM from slackbot). Leaving `as_user=true` has no effect when
  # the `channel` argument is a conversation ID.
  #
  # NOTE: This method no longer accepts `envelope.room` set to a user name. Using it in this manner will result in a
  # `channel_not_found` error.

  # @public
  # @param {Object} envelope - a Hubot Response envelope

  # being used to send an outgoing message
  # @param {User} [envelope.user] - the Hubot User object representing the user who sent `envelope.message`
  # @param {string} [envelope.room] - a Slack conversation ID for where `envelope.message` was received, usually an
  # alias of `envelope.user.room`
